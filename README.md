Wandora
=======

[Wandora](http://wandora.org) is a tool for people who collect and process information, 
especially networked knowledge and knowledge about WWW resources. With Wandora you can 
aggregate and combine information from various different sources. You can manipulate the 
collected knowledge flexible and efficiently, and without programming skills. More 
generally speaking Wandora is a general purpose information extraction, management 
and publishing application based on [Topic Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_Maps) 
and [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). Wandora suits well for 
constructing and maintaining vocabularies, taxonomies and ontologies. 
Application areas include linked data, open data, data integration, business 
intelligence, digital preservation and data journalism.
